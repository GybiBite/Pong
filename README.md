# Pong
 Pong in Java
 
 This is my attempt at Pong written in Java. This was my first real project, and I was developing it while taking a computer science class at my college. 
 
 It uses the [Processing library](https://processing.org/), which provides a lot of shorthand for using Java's canvas and AWT functions and allowing more focus on learning the syntax of the Java programming language.
 
 Features:
 - Singleplayer and multiplayer modes
 - Options to change paddle length, game length, and singleplayer difficulty
 - Very minimal framework to load "add-ons"
 
 I added the ability to create extensions with intentions of a friend of mine developing an AI that would learn how to play the game. This has yet to be finished, and there may be more on that in the future.
